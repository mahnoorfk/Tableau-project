# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
Create a Tableau Dashboard outlining interesting trends in House Prices/Office Prices and Consumer Price Index.

## Process
Import all data into Tableau
Create the different visuals
Add visuals to the dashboard
Explain interesting trends obsevered 

## Results
I chose option 1 and decided to compare house price index, benchmark prices and office prices on a line chart in order to compare the trends. When looking at the house prices for each district in Canada, it was necessary to create a heatmap. Produced a line chart with reference lines/bands in order to show the effects of the economic crises in the world during the different time periods. Chose a scatter plot in order to show the regression model of consumer price index with house price index. 

## Challenges 
Unfortunately the biggest challenge faced was importing the JSON file. I was not able to import it into Tableau and so I tried to import it into Excel but I was not able to generate the table of data.

## Future Goals
Create more plots comparing more information from the dataset, such as comparing earnings with consumer price index and also office prices per district.
